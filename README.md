Experience and goals


My name is Emily Hockman, I graduated Missouri State University in December of 2018.

Experience/languages learned:
  I have worked in groups to complete multiple projects assigned in my classes. Some projects include;
  The great race, which I completed on my own. This project involves HTML and CSS as well as JavaScript.
  
  Another project I worked on with a group is called a super hero/villian game coded all in C#. The point
  of the project is to have working code with methods consisting up to six lines of code each. 
  
  the other project I will have public is a web applcation in PHP language. This project is a replica 
  of music services like Google play music or Spotify where a customer can log in or sign up and listen to music for free.
  This web app connects to a database in MySQLi where users can play, search and create playlists on their own.
