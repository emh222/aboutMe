Experience and goals


My name is Emily Hockman, I graduated Missouri State University in December of 2018.

Experience/languages learned:
  I have worked in groups to complete multiple projects assigned in my classes. Some projects include;
  The great race, which I completed on my own. This project involves HTML combined with CSS to create a web page
  showing a backgound, two butterflys that are used to race across the screen using JavaScript. a title and a green and red 
  light to click on to start the race and start the race over. The JavaScript generates random numbers so everytime the butterflys
  race, either the purple or the yellow butterfly wins randomly.
  
  Another project I worked on with a group
